    abstract = {Multisensor data fusion is an emerging technology applied to Department of Defense (DoD) areas such as automated target recognition, battlefield surveillance, and guidance and control of autonomous vehicles, and to non-DoD applications such as monitoring of complex machinery, medical diagnosis, and smart buildings. Techniques for multisensor data fusion are drawn from a wide range of areas including artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistical estimation and other areas. This paper provides a tutorial on data fusion, introducing data fusion applications, process models, and identification of applicable techniques. Comments are made on the state-of-the-art in data fusion},

    abstract = {Multisensor data fusion refers to the acquisition, processing and synergistic combination of information gathered by various knowledge sources and sensors to provide a better understanding of a phenomenon. It is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field that has generated a lot of excitement in the research and development community. These concepts are being applied to a wide variety of fields such as military command and control, robotics, image processing, air traffic control, medical diagnostics, pattern recognition and environmental monitoring. This paper presents a brief overview of the field and illustrates its potential by means of two examples},
